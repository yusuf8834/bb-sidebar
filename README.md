# BB Sidebar

A stable thread list for [bb](https://github.com/get-bb/bb). Threads stay where you put them while status, snooze, and settle actions remain close at hand.

## Features

- Manual ordering plus Recent activity, Date created, and Project sort modes
- Subtle project grouping for projects with multiple active threads
- Pinned, Active, Inactive, Snoozed, Parked, and Settled shelves
- Project filtering
- Optional project colors with per-project color selection. Names stay colored in every mode; show stripes in full and collapsed mode, full mode only, or grouped projects only
- Automatic project icons with custom overrides
- Expandable child-thread indicators with running and attention states
- Live status, branch, pull request, and provider details
- Workspace port discovery, hover-card details, and optional browser links
- A Clean button in Settled that previews and closes live terminals and verified thread-owned listening ports, while protecting Active and Working threads
- Configurable inactive-thread and automatic cleanup rules
- Native bb navigation, split, rename, archive, and delete flows
- Project submenu on thread cards for settings, rename, local paths, and removal
- Regenerate a thread title from its last three accepted user messages
- Automatically retry missing thread titles once in the background, respecting the selected AI title service and manual edits

Title regeneration supports bb cloud, Codex, and any AI service whose plugin exposes an `ai-services.v1.complete` RPC. The sidebar calls it with `{ serviceId, task: "thread-title", prompt }` and expects `{ text }` back, within 30 seconds. bb has no API for plugins to call another plugin's AI service yet; this convention fills that gap until it does.

bb plugin install git:https://github.com/yusuf8834/bb-sidebar.git
```

Then choose **BB Sidebar** under **Settings > Appearance > Sidebar**.

This project includes code adapted from [bb-plugin-t3sidebar](https://github.com/SawyerHood/bb-plugin-t3sidebar). Its MIT copyright notice remains in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Park threads while waiting on someone else. Use **Park thread** in the context menu and **Resume** when ready. Parked threads have no timer and are excluded from automatic cleanup. Opening one leaves it parked; new thread activity brings it back to Active.

Use **Parent** in a thread's context menu to search threads in the same project, choose a parent, or select **None** to remove it. The current parent is checked; the thread itself and its descendants are excluded.
